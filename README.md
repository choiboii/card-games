## This GitHub repository is for creating iconic card games into online ones, such as war or blackjack. Most notably, I wanted to create the game, Egyptian Rat Slap, or ERS for short. This is a game commonly played at school where it required fast thinking and decision making in order to win against your opponent, and it goes beyond just counting cards or just being luckier than your opponent.

# War:
War is a simple game; split the deck evenly into an x amount of players, and then each lay your next card down. Whoever has the highest value card wins the pile, and the player with all the cards wins the game. A classic game of attrition.

# Blackjack:
Blackjack is a game based on risk management and counting cards. Each player starts with two cards, one face up for others to see and one face down for only the player to see. Then, after viewing their two cards, each player can either choose to gamble some money, or "call" (match the current bet). The dealer then goes around asking each player whether they would like to be "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (not receive any more cards). The objective of this game is to receive the closest sum of cards to 21 without going over, which otherwise would be classified as a "bust." The winner wins the pile of money; in case of a tie, the dealer wins the pile.

# Egyptian Rat Slap (ERS):
ERS is a game based on luck and skill. Once the deck is evenly split among the players, each player places a card one after another. The game continues as such until the game encounters one of two main scenarios:

1. A player places down a face card:
- When a player places down a face card, the next player has an x amount of tries to place another face card. This number x depends on which face card is placed:
    - Jack: 1 card
    - Queen: 2 cards
    - King: 3 cards
    - Ace: 4 cards
- If the next player is unable to place a face card in the amount of tries required, the player who placed the face card wins the entire pile.

2. The pile meets a condition such that it can be "slapped." 
- When the pile The player that slaps the pile takes all the cards in the pile. There are many conditions in which there can be a valid slap:
    - Double: 2 cards of the same value are placed in succession on the pile.
    - Sandwich: 2 cards of the same value are separated by a different card on the pile.
    - Tens: 2 cards in which their value add up to 10 are placed in the succession on the pile.
    - Marriage: A double consisting of a king and queen, instead of the 2 same-value cards.
    - Divorce: A sandwich consisting of a king and queen, instead of the 2 same-value cards.
- There are a plethora of other rules, such as tens sandwich, double sandwich, etc. in which consist of a combination of these rules, and perhaps in the future they will be implemented.
- If a player incorrectly slaps the pile, they will be forced to "burn" their next card, placing this card to the bottom of the deck. (Pro tip: this can also be used to get rid of unwanted cards to manipulate which card(s) you want to place next).

The game continues until a player wins all the cards in the deck.
